# Dereference of pointer with arithmetic increment/Decrement or binop operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for dereference of pointer with arithmetic increment/decrement and binop. Example: mutating `*(p++)` into `(*p)--`, `*(p+1)` to `*(p)+1`, where _p_ is a pointer. 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementing this base class.
