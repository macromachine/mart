# Dereference of pointer with arithmetic sum/difference operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for dereference of pointer with arithmetic sum/difference. Example: mutating `*(p+5)` into `(*p)+5`, where _p_ is a pointer. 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementin this base class.
