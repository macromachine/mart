# Pointer Arithmetic Increment/Decrement operation operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for pointer arithmetic Increment/Decrement operation. Example: mutating `P++` into `--P`, Where _P_ is a pointer. 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementin this base class.
