# Numeric Arithmetic Binary Operation operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for numeric arithmetic binary operation. Example: mutating `x+5` into `6/x`, where _x_ is a numeric value (integer of floating point). 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementin this base class.
