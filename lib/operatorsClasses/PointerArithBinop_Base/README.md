# Pointer Arithmetic Binary operation (Addition, Substraction) operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for pointer(address) arithmetic operation (Add, Sub). Example: mutating `P+3` into `P`, Where _P_ is an address (pointer). 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementin this base class.
