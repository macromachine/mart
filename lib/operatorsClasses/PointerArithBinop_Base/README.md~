# Pointer Arithmetic Binary operation (Addition, Substraction) operator classes

This directory contain:
    - The base abstract class implemented by each mutation operator for pointer(address) arithmetic operation (Add, Sub). Example: mutating `a&&b` into `a||b`, or `!a` into `a`. 
    - The directory operator contains the mutation operators implementin this base class.
